## 🚀 HR Analytics & Attrition Insights Project
## 📌 Project Overview
This project is focused on understanding employee trends, workforce behaviour, and attrition patterns using an HR dataset.
I completed the full analysis using Excel, SQL, Python, and Power BI.
The main goal was to clean the data, explore key patterns, Reason for Attrition and build a clear dashboard that can help HR teams make decisions.

## 🛠️ Tools & Technologies -
1. Excel – data cleaning, quick checks & summarize the data using pivot tables and charts
2. SQL (MySQL) – data manipulation & analytical queries
3. Python (Pandas + Matplotlib + Seaborn) – Data cleaning, feature enigineering, EDA & visual insights
4. Power BI – Data transformation & interactive dashboard
5. MS Word - Data Reporting

## 🎯 Objectives -
1. Clean and prepare employee data
2. Analyse factors that impact employee attrition
3. Build visual insights using Python
4. Create an HR dashboard with KPIs
5. Summarize key findings clearly

## 📊 Key Insights -
1. Highest attrition found in Support Lead and Support Agent job roles.
2. Employees Aged between 30-40 leave more often.
3. More than 2,000 employees are performing at levels higher than the organizational average performance rating score.
